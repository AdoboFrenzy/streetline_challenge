# Streetline Challenge

### Instructions on how to use the application:

 * Once running, you will be on the root route (/streetline/index), and you will see the map that was provided (from the sample_map.html.erb). 
To get started, click on the map to get a set of coordinates from an alert message (latitude, longitude), and copy and paste those to the text fields below. 
You will need to enter a name, status, color, and height as well. Click "Save Parking Meter" and this will save a new parking meter to the database.

 * The "/parkingmeters" route will list all parkingmeters as well as show, edit, and delete individuals. 
Clicking "show" will display an individual parking meter's information and data. 
Clicking edit, will allow you to modify it's information and data. 
Delete will erase the specific parking meter from the database.

 * At the top of the parkingmeter index page, you can filter the parkingmeters by filling in the inputs above "status, color, and height".
